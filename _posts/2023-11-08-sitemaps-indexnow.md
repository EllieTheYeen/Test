So there is this whole thing with SEO optimizations and all that and sitemaps and made some sitemap using liquid and it works now I think but it was like a pain to get working and stuff complains about invalid dates.

Also tried IndexNow by bing or whatever it is by and yeah it might give more search engine detection thingy like a script submits them.

Anyway I do have some stuff I wanna do today like writing a more serious post or do some drawing and I can mweeoop really good since I am a yeen deer and also I gave someone else too the yeen deer avatar now on VRChat so that is nice that someone else likes it too.
